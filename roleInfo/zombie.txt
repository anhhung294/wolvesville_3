Role description
Each night the Zombie can bite one player which will turn that player into a Zombie (unless they are a Werewolf, Cursed, President, Sect Leader or Sect members). Every zombie can bite their own person each night. The bitten player will be converted the next night.

Win conditions
The zombies win if every player has been converted into a zombie. This tends to happen a lot in games with zombies, as each zombie can bite a different player.
