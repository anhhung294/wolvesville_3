Role description
Once per game, the Pumpkin king can go trick or treating by giving the candy bucket to a dead player. That player will add a candy into the bucket and then either pass it on to another dead player, or give it back to the Pumpkin king. Once the candy bucket has been returned, all players who have given candy will receive a small gift.[1]
