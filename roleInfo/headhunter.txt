Role description
The Headhunter has no special abilities. On the first night of the game, a random villager will be assigned as their target. They win if the village lynches their target during the day.

If their target dies before the Headhunter dies, in a way other than being lynched, then the Headhunter becomes a regular villager and wins with village.

A target icon will be shown on the Headhunter's target.

Win conditions
The Headhunter wins if their target is lynched by the village. They also can win with the village if they become a villager at some point in the game.

The Headhunter only targets villagers, except for Gunner, Priest, Mayor, Cursed, Pacifist and Flower Child.
