Description
The Avenger can select a player to kill with them when they die. They don't have any other ability and they win with village.

Interactions
If the Avenger flees, the player they chose will not die.
If the Avenger is Corrupted by the Corruptor and has chosen a target, the Avenger will still be able to kill the chosen player.
If several Avengers die at the exact same time (for example, due to sect) while having the same target, the target will get killed several times.[2]
If the Avenger is the headhunter's target, gets killed by something else than the vote, and targets headhunter, headhunter will loose.[3]
If the Avenger is checked by a spirit seer, gets killed in the middle of night, and gets revived, they will still appear as blue.[4]
