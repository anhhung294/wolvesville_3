Role description
At night, the Bomber can place a bomb which will kill a maximum of 3 players. The following night, the bomb explodes, killing the selected players. The night after that, the bomber can place a new bomb. This process of placing a bomb every two nights continues until the bomber dies. The Bomber cannot be killed by the Werewolves.

Win conditions
The Bomber wins if they are the last player alive. 

Interactions
Bombs can be rotated by clicking on the central player (can be horizontal, vertical and diagonal).
The bomb can't kill the Bomber. If the Bomber and one of the victims of the first Bomb placed end up being a couple (because of the Cupid), the bomb will not kill the Bomber's lover but will still kill the other 2 players.
The bomb won't explode if Bomber is killed during the day, but will still explode if Bomber is killed during the night.
The bomb is removed if the player is killed, then revived.[1]
The bomb's explosion bypasses a possible nightmare.[2]
Bomber bypasses all protections.
