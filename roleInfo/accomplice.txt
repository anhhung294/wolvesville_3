Role description
At night, the Bandit can convert another player to be their Accomplice. Then each night, the Bandit and the Accomplice can select a player to kill.

If they vote different players, then the deciding vote will be the Accomplice's vote.

The Accomplice can be killed by werewolves.

Only villagers and random voting roles can be converted to Accomplice. Trying to convert a werewolf will result in the Bandit killing that werewolf. 
If the Accomplice dies, the Bandit can select a new Accomplice the next night. If there are several accomplices in the same game, all of them win when the Bandit wins.

Any Accomplice can kill without Bandit, but the Bandit needs an Accomplice to kill.

Win Conditions
The Accomplice wins if all alive players belong to Bandits team.

Interactions
If Sheriff checks Bandit's target while Accomplice is nightmared, Bandit will show up as suspect (instead of Accomplice).[2]
If Bandit doesn't vote at night, they will appear blue to the Spirit Seer.[3]
