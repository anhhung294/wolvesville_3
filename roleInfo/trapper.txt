Role description
Each night you can either select a player to place trap on, or you can activate all of your placed traps. Players with an active trap on them cannot be killed at night. When attacked by the werewolves, the trap will trigger, killing the weakest werewolf. Every other attack will trigger the trap without killing the attacker. When a trap is triggered, all other active traps will trigger as well. You can place a trap up on up to three players.
