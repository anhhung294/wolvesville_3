Role description
At night, the Bandit finds an Accomplice by converting another player. Then each night, the Bandit and the Accomplice can select a player to kill.

If they vote different players, then the deciding vote will be the Accomplice's vote.

The Bandit cannot be killed by the werewolves.

Only villagers and random voting roles can be converted to Accomplice. Trying to convert a werewolf will result in the Bandit killing that werewolf. 
If the Accomplice dies, the Bandit can select a new Accomplice the next night. If there are several accomplices in the same game, all of them win when the Bandit wins.
