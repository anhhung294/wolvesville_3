Role Description
The Shadow Wolf has the same abilities as an ordinary werewolf and can vote for a player to kill each night. However, once per game, the Shadow Wolf can double your team's votes during the day, while hiding all votes.

Win Condition
Shadow Wolf wins with the Werewolves.

Interactions
If two shadow wolves trick votes, every wolf's votes will count as two (and not four).[2]
Sorcerer also gets double votes during the shadow wolf's ability.[3]
