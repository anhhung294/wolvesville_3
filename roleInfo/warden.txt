Role description
Select two targets each day to put into prison the next night. At night, the targets can talk to each-other while Warden listens. The targets cannot act or be attacked, but if Warden finds either one suspicious, they can give one target a weapon. Villagers can use this weapon to kill the other player. If both of the targets are werewolves they can choose to kill Warden during the night.

Win conditions
The Warden wins with the village.
